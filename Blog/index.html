    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>The first day of the project I focused on setting up the perlin noise generator as a base for the project. Moreover, the Fractal Brownian Motion technique was also implemented and tested by printing the values as a black and white texture on a plane.</p>

    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <h3>Colored texture</h3>
    <p>On the second day, I focused on implementing a colored texture based on the perlin noise values. The texture was generated and displayed on a plane in the scene.</p>

    <h3>Marching Cubes</h3>
    <p>On the second day, I focused on implementing the marching cubes algorithm to generate a mesh from the perlin noise. The algorithm was implemented and tested by generating a mesh from the perlin noise and displaying it in the scene.</p>
